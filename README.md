### Portfolio project

This is a portfolio project, currently in development, that i'm doing to recap and put everything i've learned in [PilarTecno](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pilar-tecno/) React course in practice.

For now i'm just using [MercadoLibre API](https://developers.mercadolibre.com.ar/es_ar) for backend data, but planning on updating this to my own API in the next few weeks.
